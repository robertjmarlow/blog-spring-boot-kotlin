Basically going through [the tutorial here](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/) and then adding :sparkles: random stuff I thought would be cool :sparkles: 

Run tests with:

```sh
gradle test
```

Automagically format Kotlin source files with:

```sh
gradle ktlintFormat
```

Run Spotbugs:

```
gradle spotbugsMain
```
